An All-in-One Web Service for Scientific Research

Aim to build an all-in-one web service for the science research life. Include the following point:

- Articles collection, like zotero but keep online
- Citation network, like paperconnected website or citespace
- Paper writting, use markdown or latex online, may consider about the office online
- version edition

## How to Build
I am still have no clear idea about how to build this service in detail. But some features have design in it:

- Use docker
- Not for enterprise using, but only for personal using or small teams to use
- Build in cloud but not on the personal computer
- The configuration may a little hard cause you need to know something about Linux and docker first

## How to Use
One word: easy
No matter how the platform you use, no matter how you use pc, ipad, or laptop, and do not care about the performance of the hardware of your devices.
Open a web page and connect to your VPS, you can start or continue your science research anywhere.

## Why I Build it
I am a postgraduate student working on environmental engineering. In my scientific research time I need to jump around a lot of applications, like zotero, word, typora, obsidian, citespace, and a lot of webpages. Also, I need to spend time to configure these shit packages and 依赖关系 between them. 
Confused by them a long time, I plan to build a tool to make my work easier, and it should be build on my VPS so that I do not need to concern about the version control.
